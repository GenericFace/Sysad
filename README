So basically

FIRSTLY:

create a /home/masteruser folder and store all the bashscripts in there.

ill make changes to the .bashrc file and add alias changes very soon.

Genstudent.sh: 

go sudo -i before running it, nothing else really

Permit.sh:

install acl before using this, command: sudo apt acl

and go sudo -i

NOTE: I havent added passwords to any users, which i will be doing soon. So for now, to switch users
      use the command "su <username>"
      
      For student user, the details i use are
      
      Name:Ola, Hostel:Opal , Room:10
      Name:Jennee, Hostel:GarnetA, Room:0
      
      BEFORE DOING FEEDEFAULTERS ALIAS, run FEEPAYER alias to see the changes, thats where i used Ola account
